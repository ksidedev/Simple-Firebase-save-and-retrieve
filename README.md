### Basic Firebase save and retrieve data

This project demonstrates the basic way to save and retrieve data from Firebase database

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com

* Create a project
* Click on Database and you will have a database URL
* Replace the URL with that in firebasePushFetch

### For example: 
```sh
var myDataRef = new Firebase('https://saveimage-41a4b.firebaseio.com/');
```

Then you should be able to push to your own database.
